## Features

- **Pydantic Integration**: Leverage Pydantic's data validation and settings management.
- **Async and Sync Support**: Handle events in both asynchronous and synchronous contexts.
- **Bus Forwarding**: Easily forward events between different buses.
- **Observer Pattern**: Implement the observer pattern to keep your application decoupled.
- **Event Sourcing**: Store and manage events efficiently for future use.
- **Concurrency**: Designed to handle multiple events at once, ensuring smooth operation.

## Installation

To install Bubus, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install bubus
```

For the latest version and release notes, please visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/DaFreeqs/bubus/releases).

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started with Bubus.

### Basic Example

```python
from bubus import Bubus, Event

# Create an instance of Bubus
bus = Bubus()

# Define an event
class MyEvent(Event):
    message: str

# Define a handler
@bus.handler
async def handle_my_event(event: MyEvent):
    print(event.message)

# Emit an event
await bus.emit(MyEvent(message="Hello, Bubus!"))
```

### Forwarding Events

You can also forward events between different buses:

```python
# Create another bus
another_bus = Bubus()

# Forward events from the first bus to the second
@bus.handler
async def forward_event(event: MyEvent):
    await another_bus.emit(event)

# Emit an event to the first bus
await bus.emit(MyEvent(message="Forward this message!"))
```

### Event Sourcing

Bubus supports event sourcing, allowing you to store and replay events as needed:

```python
# Store events in a list
event_store = []

@bus.handler
async def store_event(event: MyEvent):
    event_store.append(event)

# Emit an event
await bus.emit(MyEvent(message="Store this event!"))
```
